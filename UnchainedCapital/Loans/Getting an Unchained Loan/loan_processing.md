# How long does it take to process a new loan?

In most circumstances, loan applications up to $1,000,000 can be approved for funding within 2-3 business days.  We are able to fund a new loan upon full deposit of your collateral to the loan’s escrow address. 
The steps to process a new loan
Once your application is submitted, it is sent to our loans team for review.
When terms are finalized, you will receive a notification that the loan contract is pending your signature--sign in to your Unchained Capital account to sign it.
After the contract is fully signed, the collateral deposit address is available on your loan page.
Contingent upon receiving your confirmed collateral deposit, we will initiate an ACH credit or wire for the amount financed to the bank account associated with your account. You
should receive your disbursement within one (1) to two (2) business days, subject to your bank’s funds availability policy. If you are paying off one or more existing loans, the disbursement will be applied first to the outstanding amounts due under your existing loan(s), and any remaining proceeds will be disbursed to you as described above.
Please ensure you notify us if your financial institution does not accept wire transfers or uses special routing for wire transfers.  If you are unsure what your routing and account number are, please contact your financial institution to avoid delays in funding your loan.

Loans are funded Monday through Friday, excluding banking holidays.
