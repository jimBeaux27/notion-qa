# Will taking out a loan with Unchained affect my credit?

No, taking out a loan with Unchained will not affect your credit score. We do not perform a credit check when we evaluate our borrowers. We may conduct an eligibility inquiry ("soft credit pull"), however, this will not impact your credit score.
