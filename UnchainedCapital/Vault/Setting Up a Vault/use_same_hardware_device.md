# Can I use the same hardware devices to create multiple vaults?

Yes, you can use just two keys to create multiple vaults.
You can create as many distinct vaults and loans as you would like by uploading just two keys from two hardware wallets to your Unchained Capital account.

Simply create additional vaults or loans in your account and choose the two keys you uploaded.

Tip: If you're looking for help uploading multiple keys from a single hardware device, we have a guide for that too: Can I upload multiple keys from just one hardware wallet?
