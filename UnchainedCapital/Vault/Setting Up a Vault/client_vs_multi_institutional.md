# What's the difference between the client-controlled and multi-institution models?

The client-controlled model is where you hold two-of-three keys and maintain sovereignty over your bitcoin. Unchained Capital holds the third key and acts as a backup in case you request us to sign a transaction.

The multi-institution model is where you hold one key, Unchained holds the other, and Kingdom Trust holds the third key. This model is tailored to the needs of multi-person organizations, including investment funds or small businesses.
