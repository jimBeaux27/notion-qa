# Are Unchained Capital vaults insured?


Not at this time.
Our vault product is not insured at this time because client funds are never in the direct control of Unchained Capital.

In a client-controlled vault, clients have total control over their funds, with 2-of-3 keys needed to move bitcoin. In the multi-institution model, keys are distributed among three parties, requiring a client to collaborate with Unchained Capital to move the bitcoin. In the event of a key loss or key compromised scenario, there is a recovery workflow that sweeps funds into a new vault under the control of new keys.
