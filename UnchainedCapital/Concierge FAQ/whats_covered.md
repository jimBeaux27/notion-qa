# Whatâ€™s covered?

The Concierge calls will walk your team through configuring devices, walking users through each step in the process and explaining why certain configuration decisions are made. The vault construction calls will teach you about multisig and best practices for securing hardware wallets, recovery seeds, and wallet configuration files in regard to your specific needs and living situation. Depending on the package, your Concierge team will provide operational security guidance and consulting. The team will also walk you through adding account-level security features to protect your business vault.

Support questions can be emailed directly to your vault Concierge specialist or to hello@unchained.com and a team member will assist you.
