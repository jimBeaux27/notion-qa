# How is Concierge different from a vault demo?


The Concierge Onboarding packages come with hands-on guided support for configuring devices, building vaults, and operational security guidance. In addition, we will take care of shipping hardware wallets to you. Once the setup is complete, the amount of bitcoin included with your package will be deposited into your new vault.

The vault demo is a complimentary demo of the vaults. We will provide written guides and videos to help you set up your devices and build your vault. Book a demo here.
