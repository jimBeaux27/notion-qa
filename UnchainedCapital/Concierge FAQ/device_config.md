# How does device configuration work?


Your vault specialist will coordinate times with your team members to configure your new hardware wallets, according to the manufacturerâ€™s setup steps. The calls will take place over video chat, and the vault specialist will share their screen to walk you and your team members through the steps. You will never be asked to share private key information during the phone calls.
