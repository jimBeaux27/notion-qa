# How Do I get my bitcoin?

We’ll put the bitcoin you’ve earned into your account balance and you can find it on the app. You’ll be able to withdraw your rewards once you’ve accumulated 50,000 sats.

If you’re paying with credit or debit card, your rewards may take 30 days to clear into your account as we need to verify the transaction before we can reward you.

If you’re paying with bitcoin, your points will land almost immediately!

When you’re ready to move them to your own personal wallet, just request a withdrawal and enter a bitcoin address.
