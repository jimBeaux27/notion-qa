# I see you’re launching with bitcoin only purchases – I’m completely new to this! What do I do?

Don’t worry – we’re here to help. And so are these guys: CashApp and Strike → these are the one-stop-shop options. They’ll set you up with a wallet, help you buy bitcoin, and teach you to spend it! They make it super simple. If you’re buying your bitcoin somewhere else (Swan, or maybe River), you can send your bitcoin to one of our favorite wallets (Muun or Blue Wallet) and pay a lightning invoice from there
