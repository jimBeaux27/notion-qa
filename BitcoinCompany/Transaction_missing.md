# What do I do if I notice a transaction missing?

Don’t worry – we’ve got this. Make sure the payment has gone through first. If you notice the transaction is still missing, this is pretty normal as it waits to clear the credit card systems. If it doesn’t show up within five days, get in touch with our customer support – they’ll be happy to help you out: customer support (twitter: @thebtcco, telegram: t.me/thebitcoincompany, phone: 1-877-BTC-ASST (1-877-282-2778) or email: support@thebitcoincompany.com)
